In length of time of some fucking product development and work on my shitty jobs, i've collected some peace of crappy knowledges,
which I wanna save in some shit place.

So here we're.

Shit Jekyll static site hosted on github pages with damn java and etc posts, written in md format lol.

For fuck sake.
