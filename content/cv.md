### Summary

Experience after university graduation is **7** years. The main development stack is **Java/Kotlin** ☕, **Spring** 🍃,
**RocketMQ** 🚀, **Postgres** 🐘.

I’m the person on the team you can rely on if you want to develop new
functionality without requirements and a task description, fix floating bugs that nobody wants, increase productivity
through system design taking into account restrictions and company policies, and you want a stable project even when I’m
not on duty.
